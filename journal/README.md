I got the Atari2600 out and tested it with Pacman (truly aweful game). I plugged in the signal break-out cartridge and breadboarded the signals. I tested those with a continuity check. I found my AY38910 chip and the FRAM chip. I found the old propeller-based FRAM programmer.

I programmed PACMAN into the FRAM and read it back and checked. Programmer is working. Now to wire the FRAM to the Atari2600.

I entered this project in the 1K code contest on hackaday. I am on vacation with my little laptop, so I'm just getting the project setup. More real work when I get home.
